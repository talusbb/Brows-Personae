Functional programming for NSArray
--
This category adds some methods from functional programming to the NSArray class.

It's based on blocks, so you avoid NSInvocation, selectors and what not.

I believe the code works on both iOS and OS X, but I have only tested it with the iOS SDK.

Some (pretty basic) unit-tests are also there, mostly for the purpose of documenting how everything works.

Please do fork, change stuff, add methods, tests etc. Pull requests are welcome!

TODO:
- Make it work with CocoaPods
